## DATA VERIFICATION

### ✅ What we HAVE:
1. **Quest definitions** with objectives and mob IDs
2. **Mob spawn coordinates** for all quest mobs
3. **Quest giver location** (Tinker Captain Whistlescrew)
4. **Zone IDs** correctly set to 1 (Dun Morogh)

### ❌ What's MISSING:
1. **Quest 28725** - User says this is the first quest, not in database
2. **NPC 46882 coordinates** - Windle Fusespring (turn-in for 28903)

## pfQuest Comparison
- **No additional data in pfQuest** - Both databases have identical quest and mob data
- **Both have same zone IDs** - 45 unique zones in each
- **Objective data identical** - Same mob IDs and kill counts

## Why Markers Might Not Show In-Game

If quest mob markers aren't appearing on the map, possible causes:

1. **Database not recompiled** after changes
   - Run `/qdc recompile` and restart WoW

2. **Quest not in log** 
   - Markers only show for accepted quests

3. **Quest prerequisites**
   - Quest 28725 might be required first

4. **Level requirements**
   - Character might be wrong level

5. **Questie settings**
   - Check if mob markers are enabled in options

## Testing Instructions

1. **With a gnome character:**
   - Check if quest 28725 exists as starter
   - Accept quest 28901 from Tinker Captain Whistlescrew
   - Verify mob markers appear at listed coordinates

2. **If markers don't show:**
   - `/qdc enable` to collect data
   - `/qdc export 28901` after accepting quest
   - Check what coordinates are actually used

## Conclusion

**The data is complete in the current database.** All quests have:
- Proper objective definitions with mob IDs
- Spawn coordinates for all mobs
- Quest giver locations

The pfQuest conversion would NOT add any new data for these quests - they're identical.
