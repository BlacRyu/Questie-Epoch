# Data Collection Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied Today

### 1. ✅ Fixed "Sample coords" Bug in Export
**Issue**: Export was showing "Sample coords: " with potentially invalid or missing coordinates
**Fix**: 
- Changed "Sample coords" to "Spawn locations (X total)"
- Added validation to check if coordinates are actually valid (x and y exist)
- Shows warning "⚠️ Invalid coordinate data detected" if coords are broken
- Shows total count and "... and X more" for large sets

### 2. ✅ Fixed Invalid Coordinate Storage
**Issue**: Invalid or zero coordinates were being stored in mob locations
**Fix**:
- Added validation: coordinates must have x > 0 and y > 0
- Added duplicate detection: won't store coords within 1 unit of existing location
- Shows error message when invalid coordinates are encountered
- Prevents accumulation of bad data

### 3. ✅ Added Missing NPC 1265
**Issue**: Quest 27128 "Venomous Conclusions" referenced non-existent NPC
**Fix**: Added NPC 1265 (Rudra Amberstill) to epochNpcDB.lua

### 4. ✅ Added /qdc recompile Command
**Issue**: Users needed easy way to force database recompilation
**Fix**: Added command that triggers recompile and immediately reloads UI

### 5. ✅ Fixed Service NPC Export
**Issue**: Service NPCs weren't showing in main export window
**Fix**: Modified export to include ALL data types when no quest ID specified

### 6. ✅ Added Visual Separators to Export
**Issue**: Export text was hard to read
**Fix**: Added clear section separators with "────────────────"

## Previous Fixes (from earlier session)

### 7. ✅ Optimized GetPlayerCoordinates
**Issue**: Function was taking 516ms per call
**Fix**: Added coordinate caching (100ms cache, 5s zone cache)
**Result**: Reduced to near 0ms

### 8. ✅ Fixed Container Name Capture
**Issue**: Container names showing as "Unidentified Container"
**Fix**: Better preservation of container names from tooltip/interaction

## Known Remaining Issues

### Quest Data
- **Quest 28725**: User says this is first gnome quest but it's not in database
- **pfQuest objectives**: Conversion script didn't map 'obj' field properly

### Data Collection
- Some objectives might not link to correct mobs
- Need to verify all coordinate captures are working

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test coordinate capture**:
   - Target a mob and check if coordinates are captured
   - Run `/qdc export` and verify no "Invalid coordinate data" warnings

2. **Test gnome starting area**:
   - Check if quest 28725 exists
   - Verify quest 28901 shows mob markers on map
   - Check if NPC 1265 appears for quest 27128

3. **Test service NPC capture**:
   - Talk to a flight master
   - Run `/qdc export` (no quest ID)
   - Verify flight master appears in export

## Files Modified

1. `Modules/QuestieDataCollector.lua`:
   - Lines 2460-2485: Fixed export coordinate display
   - Lines 1277-1296: Added coordinate validation
   - Multiple other improvements

2. `Database/Epoch/epochNpcDB.lua`:
   - Line 1157: Added NPC 1265

3. `Database/Epoch/epochQuestDB.lua`:
   - No changes needed (quest data was already correct)

## Next Steps

1. **Capture Quest 28725** if it exists in-game
2. **Fix pfQuest conversion** to properly extract objective data
3. **Test all fixes** with a gnome character
4. **Monitor for new issues** during data collection
