# Questie Data Collection - Simple Guide

## Don't Want to Help? No Problem!
Just use Questie normally! The addon works great for tracking quests, finding NPCs, and showing objectives on your map. You don't need to do anything special.

## Want to Help Make Questie Better? Here's How!

### What Is Data Collection?
Project Epoch has 600+ custom quests that Questie doesn't know about yet. When you play with data collection ON, Questie learns about these quests and you can share that info to help everyone.

### Quick Start (3 Easy Steps)

#### 1. Turn It On
Type in chat: `/qdc enable`

You'll see: **"[Questie] Data collection ENABLED"**

#### 2. Play Normally
Just quest like you always do! Questie quietly records:
- Where quest givers are standing
- What mobs you need to kill
- Where quest items drop
- Where to turn in quests

You'll see green messages like:
- **"[DATA] Quest Giver: Guard Thomas"** - Found a quest giver!
- **"[DATA] Quest item dropped from Wolf"** - Learned where items come from!

#### 3. Share Your Data (When Done with a Quest)
Type: `/qdc export 12345` (replace 12345 with the quest ID)

This opens a window with the quest data. Click "Copy" and paste it on GitHub.

## What to Expect While Collecting

### Good Messages (Green = Working!)
- **"Quest Giver: [Name]"** - Captured who gives the quest
- **"Quest Turn-in: [Name]"** - Captured who you turn it in to
- **"Tracked quest mob"** - Found an enemy for the quest
- **"Quest item dropped"** - Learned where items come from

### Normal Messages (Brown = Info)
- **"Tracked mob at [location]"** - Recording enemy positions
- **"Interacted with object"** - Found a clickable quest object

### Warning Messages (Red = Incomplete)
If you see **"WARNING: INCOMPLETE DATA"** it means you already had the quest when you turned collection on. To fix: abandon the quest and pick it up again.

2. **Export it**: `/qdc export [questID]`
3. **Copy the text** from the window that pops up
