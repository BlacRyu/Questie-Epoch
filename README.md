## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Ongoing Database Maintenance
**This is a living project with continuous improvements!**
- **Database maintenance is ongoing** - We're constantly updating and improving quest data
- **Bugs may still exist** - Some quests may display incorrectly or have missing information
- **Your reports matter** - Please submit bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/trav346/Questie-Epoch/releases/latest)
- **Be patient** - Project Epoch has modified thousands of vanilla quests, and we're working through them systematically
- **Help us imporove!** - Enable data collection (`/qdc enable`) to automatically contribute to database improvements

## üó∫Ô∏è New Features

### Level-Appropriate Quest Filtering
- **Fixed bug** Map now only shows quests you can realistically obtain and complete
- **FIxed Bug** Most erroneous quests should no longer appear in wrong locations or for inappropriate levels
- **Fixed Bug** Cleaner map with only relevant quests for your level

### Smart Quest Data Export
- **Automatic Pagination**: Large submissions automatically split into multiple pages
- **Character Counter**: Shows real-time usage (e.g., "45.2k/59.0k chars")
- **Smart Slicing**: Respects GitHub's 65,536 character limit
- **Unified Interface**: All exports use the same modern staged window

### Quest Completeness Indicators (What Those [Brackets] Mean)
**You might see these labels in front of quest names in your tracker. Here's what they mean:**

- **[EpochDB Missing]**: This quest doesn't exist in our database yet. Questie is doing its best to track it for you, but we don't have information about where to go or what to do. The quest will still work in-game, but Questie can't show you map markers or objectives.

- **[EpochDB Minimal]**: We know this quest exists and its name, but that's about it. We don't know where the quest giver is or what you need to do. You can still complete the quest normally, but Questie can't guide you.

- **[EpochDB Partial]**: We have some information about this quest (like who gives it or some objectives), but we're missing important details. You might see some map markers, but they could be incomplete or incorrect.

**Why do these exist?** Project Epoch has thousands of custom quests that aren't in the original WoW database. When you pick up a quest we don't know about, Questie creates a temporary placeholder (called a "runtime stub") so it can at least track your progress. As players submit data, these quests get upgraded from Missing ‚Üí Minimal ‚Üí Partial ‚Üí Complete.
